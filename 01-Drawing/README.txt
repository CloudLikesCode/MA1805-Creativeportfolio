ATTEMPT NO. 1 

IMAGE PROMPT: TARGET 

START OF MESSAGE: 

My aim for this piece is to recreate the target given to me.
By overlapping circles and changing their colour, I believe I can pass this first trial, or whatever they refer to it as.
It seems simple to replicate and should not give me and trouble attempting to do so. 
But I am new to this. I will be logging my problems and solutions as I progress, so that if a problem may arise again, it can be addressed.
